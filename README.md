# 🌈 AuraSync Color Animation Engine for Windows Forms

> 🕒 **Note:** This project was originally developed in **February 2019** and uploaded to GitHub in **October 2025** for portfolio and documentation purposes.

This project introduces a dynamic **color animation algorithm** for enhancing the visual experience of **Windows Forms applications**. Inspired by Aura Sync lighting effects, it enables real-time color transitions across UI elements such as **Labels**, **TextBoxes**, **Panels**, and more.

The algorithm is designed to be **modular**, **extensible**, and **highly customizable**, making it suitable for both aesthetic enhancements and interactive feedback systems.
